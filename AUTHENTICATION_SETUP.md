# 🔐 Authentication & Admin Dashboard Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the complete authentication system and admin dashboard for the JavaScript Mastery Course.

## 📋 Overview

The authentication system includes:
- **Student Registration & Login** - Students can create accounts and track progress
- **Admin Dashboard** - Comprehensive analytics and student management
- **Progress Tracking** - Real-time lesson completion and time tracking
- **Achievement System** - Badges and milestones for student motivation
- **Role-Based Access** - Separate interfaces for students and administrators

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Database Setup

1. **Copy the SQL script** from `database/setup.sql`
2. **Go to your Supabase dashboard** → SQL Editor
3. **Paste and run the entire script** - this will create all necessary tables, policies, and triggers
4. **Verify tables were created** in the Table Editor

> **Note**: The problematic `ALTER DATABASE` line has been removed from the script to ensure compatibility with Supabase's hosted environment.

### 2. Create Your First Admin Account

1. **Register a new account** using the registration form at `auth/register.html`
2. **Run this SQL command** in Supabase SQL Editor (replace with your email):

```sql
-- Replace 'your-admin-email@example.com' with your actual email
UPDATE auth.users 
SET raw_user_meta_data = raw_user_meta_data || '{"role": "admin"}'::jsonb
WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';

UPDATE public.users 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
```

### 3. Test the System

1. **Open** `index.html` in your browser
2. **Click "Sign Up Free"** to test student registration
3. **Click "Login"** and check the admin checkbox to test admin login
4. **Verify** that students are redirected to the student dashboard
5. **Verify** that admins are redirected to the admin dashboard
