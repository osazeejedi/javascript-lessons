# Lesson 5: Repetition (Loops) 🔄

Welcome to one of the most powerful concepts in programming! Loops allow you to automate repetitive tasks and create efficient, elegant code.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand what loops are and why they're essential
- Master for loops for counting and iteration
- Use while loops for conditional repetition
- Control loop flow with break and continue
- Create complex patterns with nested loops
- Build interactive animations and games using loops

## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. For Loops
Perfect when you know exactly how many times to repeat:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log("Count: " + i);
}
```

**Structure:**
- **Initialization**: `let i = 0` (starting point)
- **Condition**: `i < 10` (when to stop)
- **Increment**: `i++` (how to change each time)

### 2. While Loops
Continue running as long as a condition is true:
```javascript
let count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    console.log("Count: " + count);
    count++; // Don't forget to update!
}
```

**Key Point**: Always make sure the condition will eventually become false!

### 3. Loop Control
- **break**: Exit the loop completely
- **continue**: Skip to the next iteration

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) continue; // Skip 5
    if (i === 8) break;    // Stop at 8
    console.log(i); // Prints: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
}
```

### 4. Nested Loops
Loops inside loops for complex patterns:
```javascript
for (let row = 1; row <= 3; row++) {
    for (let col = 1; col <= 3; col++) {
        console.log(`Row ${row}, Column ${col}`);
    }
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Canvas Drawing System
```javascript
// Pattern drawing with nested loops
function drawCirclePattern() {
    for (let row = 0; row < 8; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < 12; col++) {
            const x = 50 + col * 50;
            const y = 50 + row * 40;
            ctx.arc(x, y, 15, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
            ctx.stroke();
        }
    }
}
```

### Animation System
```javascript
// Rain animation using arrays and loops
function startRainAnimation() {
    const raindrops = [];
    
    // Create raindrops with loop
    for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
        raindrops.push({
            x: Math.random() * canvas.width,
            y: Math.random() * canvas.height,
            speed: Math.random() * 3 + 2
        });
    }
    
    // Animation loop
    setInterval(() => {
        for (let drop of raindrops) {
            // Update and draw each raindrop
            drop.y += drop.speed;
            if (drop.y > canvas.height) {
                drop.y = -20;
                drop.x = Math.random() * canvas.width;
            }
        }
    }, 50);
}
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Loop Performance
- Be careful with nested loops - they can slow down your program
- Use break to exit early when you find what you're looking for
- Consider the time complexity of your loops

### Common Patterns
```javascript
// Counting up
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { }

// Counting down
for (let i = 10; i > 0; i--) { }

// Array iteration
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { }

// While with condition
while (condition) {
    // Do something
    // Update condition!
}
```

### Debugging Loops
- Use console.log to track loop progress
- Check your loop conditions carefully
- Make sure variables are updated correctly
- Watch out for infinite loops!

- Step-by-step pattern generation
- Animation frame updates
- Performance statistics

The console shows exactly how each loop works, making it perfect for understanding the flow of execution.

## ⚡ Performance Notes

### Efficient Loops
```javascript
// Good: Cache array length
const len = array.length;
for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) { }

// Good: Use appropriate loop type
for (let item of array) { } // For iteration
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { } // For counting
```

### Animation Optimization
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Limit the number of animated elements
- Clear and redraw efficiently
- Stop animations when not visible
